Version: 0.0.1
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "First",
           family = "Last",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "first.last@example.com",

Description: A simple example repo to test making an R package
  from C++ code using SWIG to generate wrapper code. The goal is
  to make it easy to install for both Linux, MacOS and Windows
  users. Windows users should be able to install a binary package
  to not require tools to compile the C++ code.
